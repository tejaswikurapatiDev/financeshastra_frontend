        Before getting down to the ways of how to invest in mutual funds, it is crucial to understand what a mutual fund
        is. Put simply, a mutual fund is an avenue of investment in which several investors allocate capital to a pool
        of capital. The money that is collected in this pool is then invested in a number of securities. Therefore,
        rather than a mutual fund being called an instrument of investment, it is actually a vehicle to invest in
        securities like stocks. Via a mutual fund, it is possible to invest in various securities, namely, stocks,
        gold, bonds, and certain instruments in the money market.
