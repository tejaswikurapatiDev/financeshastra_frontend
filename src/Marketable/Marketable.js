      Equity Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a type of investment fund that tracks a specific index, commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets. They are similar to mutual funds in that they
pool money from investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. However, unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares
throughout the trading day, just like individual stocks.<br/><br/>

Equity ETFs are passive investment instruments that are based on indices and invest in securities in same proportion as the underlying index. Because of its index mirroring property,
there is a complete transparency on the holdings of an ETF. Further due to its unique structure and creation mechanism, the ETFs have much lower expense ratios as compared to
mutual funds.
