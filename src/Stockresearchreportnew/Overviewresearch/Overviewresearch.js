                <h3>Transition in UK Business</h3>
                <p>
                    Tata Steel Management is optimistic about the potential turnaround of UK operations in the coming quarters. They anticipate achieving breakeven or slightly positive EBITDA by the second half of FY25,
                    largely due to the activation of the second blast furnace in the latter half of the fiscal year
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the company aims to attain debt-free status for its UK and Netherlands operations within the next 12 to 18 months, as part of a broader strategy to stabilise financial
                    performance and improve working capital by the end of the current financial year.

                <h3>Expansion Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    Tata Steel is targeting a production capacity of 40 MTPA by 2030, but with its current momentum, it is likely to achieve this ahead of schedule. The company has allocated Rs 27,000 crore for the Phase-II expansion of its Kalinganagar plant. Furthermore, for FY2026, Tata Steel has outlined a broader capital
                    expenditure plan of Rs 19,000 crore, with 75% directed towards expanding its operations in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tata Steel is expanding production capacities at its Kalinganagar, Meramandali, and Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) facilities, increasing them from 3 MTPA to 8 MTPA, 5 MTPA to 7 MTPA, and 1 MTPA to 10 MTPA, respectively. This expansion will bring the company's total production capacity in India to approximately 37 MTPA. Additionally, Tata Steel plans to
                    establish an Electric Arc Furnace in Ludhiana within the next two years.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, Tata Steel's management anticipates an increase in annual steel production capacity of approximately 1.4 million tons following the planned relining of the G-blast furnace at the Jamshedpur facility, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of FY2025.</p>

                <h3>Concall Highlights</h3>
                <p>
                    Tata Steel has received board approval to install an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) at its Port Talbot facility in the UK, with operations expected to commence by March 2026.
                    The project is backed by a £1.25 billion investment, which includes a £500 million grant from the UK government.
                </p>
                <p>Tata Steel's net debt stood at Rs 88,817 crore as of September 2024, while the company reported liquidity of Rs 26,000 crore, which includes cash & cash equivalents of Rs 10,575 crore. For the first half of FY25, Tata Steel reported consolidated revenues of
                    Rs 1,08,676 crore, with EBITDA increased by 25% year-on-year to Rs 13,046 crore and an EBITDA margin of 12%. </p>
                <p>In the Q2FY25 quarter, the Company’s consolidated revenues stood at Rs 53,905 crore, with EBITDA at Rs 6,224 crore.
                    While company’s Netherlands business contributed revenues of £1,300 million, with an EBITDA of £22 million.</p>
                <p>In FY 2023-24, Tata Steel Netherlands faced significant challenges, including negative EBITDA and cash flow due to delays in the relining of Blast Furnace 6. These issues led to reduced production and increased costs. For FY 2024-25, management anticipates
                    that Blast Furnace 6 will be fully operational, improving production and efficiency. With
                    stabilizing material costs, the company expects enhanced EBITDA margins, cash flow, and overall profitability.</p>
<p>Tata Steel is focusing on improving its financial health by targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 2.5 by the end of FY2024. This strategic move is part of the company's broader efforts 
    to manage its debt levels and enhance operational efficiency amid ongoing challenges in the steel market.</p>
    <p>The company has commissioned a blast furnace at Kalinganagar with a production capacity of 7,500 tons per day. Management aims to increase this to 15,000 tons per day, with a target of achieving 10,000 tons per day by the fourth quarter of this year. Management anticipates adding 1.1 million tons of volume from Kalinganagar this year, with plans to increase this to around
         3.5–4 million tons next year and achieve the full capacity of 5 million tons in the following year.</p>
         <p>In the first quarter of FY25, the Dutch government announced a proposed €3 billion investment in environmental subsidies to support Tata Steel’s decarbonization efforts at the Ijmuiden plant. This initiative includes plans to replace one of the two blast furnaces with a Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) plant and an Electric
             Arc Furnace (EAF) by 2030, which is anticipated to lead to a significant reduction in CO₂ emissions.</p>

                <h3>Business Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    In Q2FY25, the company commissioned a 5 MTPA blast furnace at Kalinganagar and incurred capital expenditures of approximately ₹4,800 crore during the quarter, totaling ₹8,585 crore for the half-year, primarily in India. The company also commissioned a second 5 MTPA blast furnace at Kalinganagar, with an investment of around ₹3,900 crore.Additionally, the company plans to commission associated facilities for
                     the Kalinganagar expansion, with an estimated investment of nearly ₹19,000 crore in the current financial year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In FY 2023-24, Tata Steel reported consolidated revenues of approximately Rs 2,29,171 crore, down from Rs 2,43,353 crore in FY 2022-23. The company also reported a net loss of Rs 4,910 crore, a significant decline from a profit of Rs 8,075 crore in the previous fiscal year.
                </p>
                <p>The decline in Tata Steel's profit after tax (PAT) for FY 2023-24 was due to several factors, including a Rs 12,560 crore impairment charge from restructuring its UK operations. Additionally, falling steel prices due to heightened competition and increased imports, particularly from China, negatively impacted profit margins. Operational disruptions in Europe further contributed to the decline.</p>

                <h3>About  the Steel Industry</h3>
                <p>
                    India ranks as the world's second-largest producer of crude steel, achieving production levels of 143.6 million tons (MT) of crude steel and 138.5 MT of finished steel in the fiscal year 2024. The Indian steel market is anticipated to grow significantly, increasing from 135.81 million tons 
                    in 2024 to 209.93 million tons by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.18%. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This expansion is primarily attributed to the enhancement of infrastructure, encompassing roads, railways, and urban development, which is crucial in driving steel demand. Key governmental initiatives such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), GatiShakti, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the Nal se Jal initiative, alongside urban development programs targeting small and medium towns, have further reinforced the sector. Collectively, these measures highlight the vital role of 
                    steel in fostering India’s economic growth and facilitating infrastructure development.
                </p>
                <p>In the near term, the industry is expected to add 27.5 million tons per annum (mtpa) of new capacity between FY2025 and FY2027, with 15.6 mtpa slated for FY2025 alone. This expansion aligns with the rising demand, pushing utilisation rates to a decade-high of approximately 88%. The industry is well-positioned to meet 
                    this increased consumption, ensuring sustainable growth.</p>
                    <p>The steel sector contributes around 2% to India’s GDP and has a substantial multiplier effect. For every unit of steel produced, GDP increases by 1.4 times, reflecting its strong impact on the economy. Steel is critical to industries such as construction, automotive, and machinery, which depend heavily on it for their operations, making the sector a key driver of economic activity and employment in the country.</p>
